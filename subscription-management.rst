Manage or renew your Ubuntu Pro subscription online
===================================================


If you are an online shop customer, you can manage and renew your Ubuntu Pro subscription on the `Ubuntu Pro dashboard <https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`_.
 
.. Important::
   
   You must be either an administrator or billing user in order to make changes to your Ubuntu Pro subscription.

Add or remove seats
-------------------

To increase or decrease the number of machines in your subscription, select the subscription you wish to manage, then click *Edit subscription*. Update the quantity as required.

Renew your subscription
-----------------------

Your subscription will automatically renew on its expiry date. You can check and update your renewal settings on the *Renewal settings* menu, for example, if your organisation does not allow auto-renewal.

To renew your subscription after it has expired, log in to the `Ubuntu Pro dashboard <https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`_ and click *Renew subscription*. Alternatively, you can purchase a new subscription via the `online shop <https://ubuntu.com/pro/subscribe>`_.

.. Important::

   Make sure that your payment method is up to date. To update your credit card information, go to *Payment Methods* on the `Ubuntu Pro dashboard <https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`_.
   
Cancel your subscription
------------------------

To cancel a subscription, click *Edit subscription*, then click the hyperlink at the bottom of the module, “You can cancel this subscription online or contact us.” Note that cancelling a subscription means it will not automatically renew. Your subscription will remain active until its expiry date.
