Renew your subscription

Your subscription will automatically renew on its expiry date. You can check and update your renewal settings on the *Renewal settings* menu, for example, if your organisation does not allow auto-renewal.

To renew your subscription after it has expired, log in to the `Ubuntu Pro dashboard <https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`_ and click *Renew subscription*. Alternatively, you can purchase a new subscription via the `online shop <https://ubuntu.com/pro/subscribe>`_.

Cancel your subscription
------------------------

To cancel a subscription, click *Edit subscription*, then click the hyperlink at the bottom of the module, “You can cancel this subscription online or contact us.” Note that cancelling a subscription means it will not automatically renew. Your subscription will remain active until its expiry date.
