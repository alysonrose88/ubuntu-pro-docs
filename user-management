User management in Ubuntu Pro
=============================

As part of your subscription to Ubuntu Pro, you have access to three customer portals:

* `The Ubuntu Pro dashboard <https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard>`_ - to access your Pro token and, for online shop customers, to manage your subscription to Ubuntu Pro
* `The Support Portal <https://support-portal.canonical.com/>`_ - to access our Knowledge Base and open support cases
* `Landscape SaaS <https://landscape.canonical.com>`_ - for management of Ubuntu machines

User management is not integrated across these portals, meaning you will need to add or remove users from each one as needed. This page explains how to manage users in each portal.

.. Important::
  
   The named technical contact on an Ubuntu Pro subscription will automatically be granted administrator-level access to the Ubuntu Pro dashboard and the Support Portal. `Landscape accounts are created separately <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pro/account-setup/#set-up-a-new-landscape-saas-account>`_.

The Ubuntu Pro dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Add a new user**

* From the dashboard, select *Account users* on the bar at the top of the page.
* Click *Add new user*, then provide the name and email address of the new user.
* Select their role type:
      * Administrators can access the Pro token, manage users and, for online shop customers, manage subscriptions and invoices.
      * Billing contacts can manage subscriptions and invoices, for online shop customers, but cannot access the Pro token and cannot manage users.
      * Technical contacts can access the Pro token but cannot manage users or subscriptions/invoices.
* New users should follow the instructions `here <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pro/account-setup/>`_ to log into the Pro dashboard.

**Remove a user**

* From the dashboard, select *Account users* on the bar at the top of the page.
* Click to *Edit* the user whose access you wish to disable, then click the trash bin icon and confirm your action.

The Support Portal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Add a new user**

Depending on the access level you wish to grant to the new user, you can create a new user yourself or open a support case requesting the update.

**Administrator-level users** can open and manage tickets and can create new users in the Support Portal.

**Non-administrator level users** can open and manage tickets, but cannot create new users in the Support Portal.

For non-administrator level users:

* From the Support Portal homepage, click the menu on the top bar and select *My Account*.
* Review the list of contacts and users on your account - your new user may already be added as a non-user contact to your account.
* If you can see your new user’s details already added, click to edit them, then check the box “Active Support Portal user” and hit save.
* If you cannot see your new user’s details, click *Add contact* and provide their name, email address and job title. Select the box “Active Support Portal user” and hit save.
* New users should follow the instructions :ref: `here <account-setup>` to log in to the Support Portal.

For administrator-level users, please open a case in the Support Portal to request that they are added as a new user to your account. Include the new user’s name, email address and job title, and specify that they should be enabled as an administrator.

**Remove a user**

* From the Support Portal homepage, click the menu on the top bar and select *My Account*.
* Click to edit the user whose access you wish to disable, then de-select the field “Active Support Portal user” and hit save.

Landscape SaaS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Add a new user**

* Navigate to *Administrators* from your `Landscape homepage <https://landscape.canonical.com>`_  navigate and scroll down to Invite an administrator.
* Provide the new user’s name and email address and role.
* Click to send the invitation to join your Landscape account.

**Note** that roles are custom defined in Landscape and control the access level individual users have within Landscape and to specific machines in your environment. As a best practice we always recommend only giving Landscape administrators enough access to perform their job.
You can read more about roles `here <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/landscape/reference/terms/roles/>`_.

**Remove a user**

* Log into your Landscape SaaS account and navigate to *Administrators*.
* Select the user whose access you wish to disable, then click *Disable*.
